        <h5 class="card-title">Debugging failed builds is hard</h5>
        Each build produces thousands of lines of output split among multiple
        log files. And the relevant error message can be anywhere. It's just
        like a needle in a haystack.

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Does it matter?</h5>
        Veteran packagers have an intuition where the error message will most
        likely be, but the process is tedious regardless. Newbies are often
        overwhelmed by the complexity and miss the error message completely.

        <h5 class="card-title">What is our goal?</h5>
        Train an AI model to understand RPM build logs and explain the failure
        in simple words, with recommendations how to fix it. You won't need to
        open the logs at all.

        <h5 class="card-title">How can I help?</h5>
        We cannot do this without your help. A large set of RPM build logs needs
        to be collected and anotated to serve as training data. Please help us
        to improve the RPM packaging ecosystem by contributing your failed build
        logs or reviewing the data we already have.
